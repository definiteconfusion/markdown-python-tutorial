For this project, you will need to use Python's <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3048">input()</code> function, this function takes one argument, and poses the argument as the prompt for the user, the user's response then becomes the value returned from the function. <br> Example:</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
userResponse = input(&quot;What's your favorite Color? &quot;)
print(f&quot;Hey, mine's {userResponse} too!&quot;)
</div><p id="u5qrw_3051">This script asks the user for their favorite color, then their answer is given to the variable <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3052">userResponse</code> and printed within an f-string.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="step-one" data-toc="step-one">Step One</h2><p id="u5qrw_3053">First off, we need some jokes, you can go <a href="https://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jokes1.pdf" id="u5qrw_3054" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and pick a few. Once you have a few we are going to create a list of these jokes, I'm only going to use three, but you can use as many as you'd like</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
jokeList = [
&quot;Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny?&quot;,
&quot;What kind of pig can you ignore at a party? A wild bore.&quot;,
&quot;What kind of murderer has fiber? A cereal killer.&quot;
]
</div></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="step-two" data-toc="step-two">Step Two</h2><p id="u5qrw_3056">Ok, now we need to be able to tell each of these jokes, while we could hard code an if statement to print each statement individually, it's much more efficient and readable to use a loop, in this case we are going to call this loop &quot;jokes&quot;, it is going to run the code inside the same number of times as there are items in the list, that way we can tell each joke regardless of how many jokes there are.</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
for jokes in range(len(jokeList)):
</div></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="step-three" data-toc="step-three">Step Three</h2><p id="u5qrw_3058">Now we need to ask the user if they would like to hear our wonderful jokes, we are going to use an if statement to check and see if this is the first time the loop has run, because we don't want to ask the user the same question every time. The reason this works is because, in a loop, the name of the loop is given the value of the number of times the loop has executed its chunk of code, in our case, the loops name is <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3059">jokes</code>, and all loops start at <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3060">0</code>, so by checking if <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3061">jokes == 0</code>, we are checking to see if this is the first execution. The else statement is used so that every other time the user is prompted to continue, it uses the second question instead.</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
    if jokes == 0:
        userAnswer = input(&quot;Would you like to hear a joke?: &quot;)
    else:
        userAnswer = input(&quot;Would you like to hear another?: &quot;)
</div></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="step-four" data-toc="step-four">Step Four</h2><p id="u5qrw_3063">Now we finally get to the good part, telling the jokes. After the user has answered, we check to see if the user has said yes or no, if they have say yes (or any anything containing a 'y') we tell a joke and ask again, if they say no (or any anything containing a 'n'), we use the <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3064">break</code> keyword to tell Python to exit the loop and execute any code after the loop, if the user says anything that doesn't fall under those two conditions, we tell the user that their input was unrecognized (with the print statement) and restart the loop (using the <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3065">contiunue</code> keyword). <br><span class="control" id="u5qrw_3067">Also, as an important sidenote</span>, if you have a keen eye, you may have noticed a <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3068">\n</code> at the end of one of the print statements, in Python the backslash is known as an 'escape character'. This means that whatever character follows it has a different effect, in this case, our following character is an 'n', this creates a new line in the terminal, in this case there is nothing after the <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3069">\n</code> statement so the new line is empty, however anything placed after the <code class="code" id="u5qrw_3070">\n</code> statement wil be printed in the next line</p><div class="code-block" data-lang="python">
    if &quot;y&quot; in userAnswer:
        print(jokeList[jokes])
